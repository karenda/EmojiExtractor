# EmojiExtractor
Tool for extracting Apple Color Emoji .ttc font.
(Shh, basically it's just a scanner tool that scans a file for .png's and allows to limit extraction to a defined minimum width.)

Usage: `EmojiExtractor <font> <min_width>`

# Wishlist / ToDo
- Extract with correct Unicode names and IDs
- Auto categorize for easy updating / maintenance after Unicode updates
